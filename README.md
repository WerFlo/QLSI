# QLSI
Acquisition and analysis of QLSI data with MATLAB for quantitative phase imaging (QPI).

The folder 'AcquisitionGui' contains a acquisition software to record QLSI data with a Phasics SID4Bio wavefront sensor and a inverted microscope stand Zeiss Axio Observer 7. The software allows for direct wavefront estimation.

The folder 'RetrievalTools' contains a modular analysis package which allows to customize the retrieval of QLSI data sets. This especially enables to minimize artifacts which arise from large-scale imaging.
Essential parts of the analysis package are based on the description of Guillaume Baffou 2021 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54 294002 and contain several elements of the related MATLAB code which is accessible at https://github.com/baffou/CGMprocess with permission of Guillaume Baffou.

A brief description for the use of each function can be found in the respective file.
